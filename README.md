# 🚢 **Titanic Survival Analysis**

*A data analysis project on Titanic survival patterns using **Python** and **Power BI**. This project explores survival trends based on factors such as age, gender, class, and fare, with interactive visualizations in Power BI.*

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**
- **🔍 Objective:** Identify key factors influencing passenger survival.
- **🛠 Tools Used:**  
  - 🐍 **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data analysis & visualization  
  - 📊 **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation  
  - 📂 **Excel** – Data preprocessing  

---

## 📊 **Dataset Details**
The dataset includes passenger information such as:

| Feature       | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Survival**  | 0 = No, 1 = Yes                                 |
| **Pclass**    | Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)                 |
| **Sex**       | Male or Female                                  |
| **Age**       | Age of the passenger                           |
| **SibSp**     | Number of siblings/spouses aboard              |
| **Parch**     | Number of parents/children aboard              |
| **Fare**      | Ticket fare                                     |
